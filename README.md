# Objects, Classes, Inheritance And Method Overloading

## Overview

This project is written in C# as part of my journey to becoming a backend developer. It serves as a practical exercise to test and enhance my skills in inheritance, classes & objects, and method overloading. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and how they can be applied to create flexible and maintainable code. 

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and inheritance to model real-world entities.
- **Validation**: Implements input validation for properties, ensuring that values meet specified criteria.
- **Exception Handling**: Includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and runtime exceptions gracefully.
- **Customizable Output**: Displays dynamic information about animals and their sounds.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to allow easy extension with additional animal types or functionalities.
